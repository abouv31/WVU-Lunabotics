testing in general

sensors should run in threads to maximize scan opportunities

initial localization

shrink buffers back down to size, assume one of 2 known starting positions, facing center of arena as initial position for current map buffer

use another particle swarm to find 6 circles (x, y of center and radius) that are as small as possible, but cover the maximum amount of known obstacles from overall map

save a rescue overall map to revert to if overall map becomes noisy


// probably will be scraped since we won't have
// enough particles to worry about it
//write tests for swarm heap code
